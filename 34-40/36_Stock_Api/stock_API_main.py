'''
the reason we wanted to do a list comprehension is because for this program to work we need the program to be
dynamic. we will reference the index position instead of the key name to make this happen.
initially i forgot to specify the index ["Time Series (Daily)"] on line 22. I kept getting a keyError on line 25
because ["4. close"] was not listed under the initial tree meta data.
the items() gives not just the item but the key, value pairs in dictionary
